# filter-project
I was trying to practice filters here.
With the top green buttons you can filter the orange ones.
If you wish to add something in the first input please type what it should be and add a description in the second input field and finally hit the div creation button.
What you have just created will be added to the category which you indicated in the first input field so again you can sort be the green buttons you you'll see what you 've just added.
